## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I am an avid traveller and often end up at AirBnBs when looking for cheap and individual accommodation during my trips. As I am fairly familiar with what to look for when am I go abroad to other countries but never you them in my own backyard, I want to dive into AirBnB data in my own hometown, Munich. 
For this project use data collected via http://insideairbnb.com/munich/ to better understand:

1. How is the overall price level for staying in Munich?
2. What neighborhoods are the most expensive/cheapest?
3. During what time is the trip to Munich most/least expensive?
4. What are the most common amenities and are they influencing the overall price level?
