There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I am an avid traveller and often end up at AirBnBs when looking for cheap and individual accommodation during my trips. As I am fairly familiar with what to look for when am I go abroad to other countries but never you them in my own backyard, I want to dive into AirBnB data in my own hometown, Munich. 
For this project use data collected via http://insideairbnb.com/munich/ to better understand:

1. How is the overall price level for staying in Munich?
2. What neighborhoods are the most expensive/cheapest?
3. During what time is the trip to Munich most/least expensive?
4. What are the most common amenities and are they influencing the overall price level?

>Inside Airbnb is a mission driven activist project with the objective to:
>Provide data that quantifies the impact of short-term rentals on housing and residential communities; and also provides a platform to support advocacy for policies to protect our >cities from the impacts of short-term rentals.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here focused on data retreival, data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

- The average price per person per night is 38\\$. Typically hosts tend to ask for "rounded" prices (30\\$, 40\\$, 50\\$ etc.).
- The most expensive areas in Munich seem to be Altstadt-Lehel (48\\$ on avg.), Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt (44\\$), Maxvorstadt (41\\$) and Schwanthalerh√∂he (40\\$).
- Least expensive seem to be Sendling-Westpark, Aubing-Lochhausen and Feldmoching-Hasenbergl (30\\$).
- Price per night seems to increase by ~2.8% in 2022, aligning well with inflation.
- Stays are especially expensive during Oktoberfest (~160\\$ per day and accommodation from 17.09.-04.10.2022) and during the BAUMA (~164\\$ per day and accommodation from 23.10.-28.10.2022). BAUMA is the world's leading exposition for construction machinery.
- Most offered amenities are Wifi, kitchen, smoke alarm and hair dryer, but amenities in general don't seem to have a huge impact on the asked price.
